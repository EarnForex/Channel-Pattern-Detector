# Channel Pattern Detector

Channel Pattern Detector is an indicator for MT4 and MT5 by EarnForex.com. It detects ascending, descending and horizontal channel chart patterns and markes them with lines directly on the chart.

The indicator supports multiple input parameters to relax or restrict the channel rules. It can also issue alerts upon detecting a new channel.
